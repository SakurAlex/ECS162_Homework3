- What AI tool did you use?
    - I used both Chatgpt and courseassist for support on homework 3.
- How did you use it? What kind of questions did you ask? (include links to your conversation if applicable)
    - Courseassist
        - This is our requirements for homework 3.
        - Could you provide some mongodb knowledge necessary for this homework? What should I do?
        - According to the homework3 requirements, the process of commenting is: click on the title of the article, 
        then another page appears with the title, and user can comment on the article. Is it correct?
    - Chatgpt
        - Why my console shows: Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/Top.svelte' does not provide an export named 'user' (at Content.svelte:7:12)
        This is my code please check is there any problem causing this error: {Top.svelte}
        - What is getContext, why it is used instead of import { user }?
- How much did it help you? How helpful and accurate was it?
    - The AI provides helpful ideas to guide me wht to do in most of the time. It really depends on the way of asking the problems.
