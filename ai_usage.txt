    - Courseassist
        - This is our requirements for homework 3.
        - Could you provide some mongodb knowledge necessary for this homework? What should I do?

        (tutorials) - What is getContext, why it is used instead of import { user }?
            - getContext is used in Svelte to access values provided by ancestor components via setContext, enabling context-specific dependency injection without prop drilling, unlike directly importing a shared global value.

        (tutorials) - How to ensure the grey layer covered on the rest part of the page is always on the top?
            - Set Z dimension as 1000, so it is always on the top of the layers.

            - Use fetch post from the lecture, and use nestComment function to ensure that the parents and children of the commment can be found. {#each ... as ...} can be used to repeatedly load the comments.
        (tutorials) - What does {#each ... as ...} mean?
            - It is like for_each to repeat a part in Svelte.
        (tutorials) - How to nest the comments?
            - Specify the parent of each comment and create a function to nest them.
        (tutorials) - Why the file cannot identify itself?
            - We have to import its self explicitly.
        (code debug) - Why every time I click on the title, it alerts "fail to fetch"?
        (code debug) - Why I cannot post comment because "unauthorized" when I log in as admin?
            - Use inspect -> network to check if the fetch is valid.
        (tutorials) - Am I able to connect Mongodb database of all the comments?
            - Just use mongodb://root:rootpassword@localhost:27017/hw3-app?authSource=admin, use localhost instead of mongodb in the middle.

- How much did it help you? How helpful and accurate was it?
    - The AI provides helpful ideas to guide me wht to do in most of the time. It really depends on the way of asking the problems.
    - In addition, it provides idea about debugging when I cannot figure out where is the mistake. I prefer to ask the AI any cause of the error message.
    - When I am not familiar with the functionalities of the tools, AI can provide summary about it.
