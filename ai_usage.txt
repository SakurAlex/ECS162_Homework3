- What AI tool did you use?
    - I used both Chatgpt and courseassist for support on homework 3.

    - Courseassist
        - This is our requirements for homework 3.
        - Could you provide some mongodb knowledge necessary for this homework? What should I do?
        - According to the homework3 requirements, the process of commenting is: click on the title of the article, 
        then another page appears with the title, and user can comment on the article. Is it correct?
    - Chatgpt
        - Why my console shows: Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/Top.svelte' does not provide an export named 'user' (at Content.svelte:7:12)
        This is my code please check is there any problem causing this error: {Top.svelte}
        - What is getContext, why it is used instead of import { user }?
        - Why the file init-mongo.js at the base menu does not create the database for me in Mongodb compass?
        - The error reported by the terminal after using your command: {error}
        - Where can I possibly find the username and password?
        - Why I got the error {ValueError: You must specify a URI or set the MONGO_URI Flask config variable}
    - Key command generated by AI
        - Connect init-mongo.js to mongodb compass:
            - Get-Content .\init-mongo.js | docker exec -i ecs162_homework3-mongo-1 mongosh "mongodb://root:rootpassword@localhost:27017/"
- How much did it help you? How helpful and accurate was it?
    - The AI provides helpful ideas to guide me wht to do in most of the time. It really depends on the way of asking the problems.
